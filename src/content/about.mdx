Hi there! I'm **Vincent Langlois**, a passionate software engineer with a focus on web development and accessibility. 
I graduated from Indiana University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Game Design.
I have a strong foundation in computer science principles and a keen interest in creating inclusive digital experiences.

I grew up surrounded by technology, from the early days on online games to the rise of smartphones. I even had a desktop at the age of 3, 
which sparked my curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. This led to me to build my own personal games and websites, and eventually to pursue a career in software engineering.

I'm also a big fan of building and making _things_, including LEGO sets, Minecraft worlds, video games, furniture, paintings, meals, and more! Give me something I can build, and I'll be happy : >.

## Fun Facts
- I love to cook and experiment with new recipes
- I enjoy playing video games, especially those with rich narratives and immersive worlds.
- I got a reasonable-sized collection of LEGO sets and comic books, which I love to display and show off.
- I have a passion for photography and enjoy capturing moments in nature and urban settings.
- I enjoy worldbuilding and creating immersive experiences, whether in games or through storytelling.
